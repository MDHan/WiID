## 'WiID: Precise WiFi-Based Person Identification via Bio-electromagnetic Information' Related Code and Dataset.

WiID is a WiFi-based person IDentification (WiID) method, which can capture people's valid physiological information from Channel State Information (CSI) of different spatial streams even when people are in motion. 
The key idea is to detect and extract the short-time static states from the collected CSI and achieve person identification based on these short-time signals. 
By designing a Motion Sensitivity Vector (MSV) conversion algorithm, WiID is able to segment CSI that carries individual physiological information automatically without the individual performing an assigned action or maintaining a specific state. 
As far as we know, it is the first work that enables precise person identification using people's physiological information when people do not keep stationary.
